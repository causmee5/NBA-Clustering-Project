# NBA-Clustering-Project
This project explored clustering assignments using NBA player data with respect to a Fantasy Basketball scenario. If you wanted to make a trade with another Fantasy manager, could you effectively evaluate the fairness of a trade made on a given date for that players position? Data used was collected from a previous project with a small team of interested students in a database used for future personal projects.

Through using KMeans clustering and DBScan clustering, the idea was to evaluate the efficacy of two different clustering methods on NBA player statistics. It was discovered that KMeans and DBScan appeared to create distinguishable clusters to use to compare the "fairness" of a trade, however we saw that DBScan failed to distribute players into clusters even remotely evenly with 99% of players appearing in one cluster. It was suspected that this was due to the lack of variability (inherent) in sports data as players are all relatively similar with few standing out and few underperforming and therefore the density based clustering algorithm grouped nearly all players into one group.
